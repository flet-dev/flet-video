??? note "Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)"
    On WSL, you need to additionally install the [`libmpv`](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) library.
    
    If you receive `error while loading shared libraries: libmpv.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`, 
    it means `libmpv` library is not installed in your WSL environment.
    
    To install it, run the following commands:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libmpv-dev libmpv2
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so /usr/lib/libmpv.so.1
    ```
